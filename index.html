  <div id="tribute-info">Mohammed Rafi (24 December 1924 â€“ 31 July 1980) was an Indian playback singer. He is considered as one of the greatest and most influential singers of 
  the Indian subcontinent. Rafi was notable for his voice, versatility and range; his songs were varied from fast peppy numbers to patriotic songs, sad numbers to highly romantic 
  songs, qawwalis to ghazals and bhajans to classical songs. He was known for his ability to mould his voice to the persona and style of an actor, lip-syncing the song on screen 
  in the movie.
